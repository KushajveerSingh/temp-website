## Personal Values

- Limit network access to core functionality (no automatic check for updates, ...).
    - Support offline mode. Store local data in simple text formats without encryption so users can view it without the app. If encryption is needed, provide easy access to keys so users can decrypt data outside the app.
- Make software open-source (optionally open-contribution).
    - Provide detailed documentation so users can modify the source code for their needs. This includes writing software that is easy is maintain, and expand. This allows users to debloat the software per their needs. The documentation on customizing software can go as deep as the last if-condition.
        - For example, if the application supports two payment methods (check and payment processor).
        - Write each type in a different file, with common API structure.
        - This allows user to delete one type of payment, or add a third type easily.
    - Never force the user to read the source code to infer logic, valid config options.
    - Provide detailed documentation on DevOps. This lets advanced users integrate and customize the app within their DevOps environment.
        - Allow users to run software locally. If the application can benefit from peer-to-peer, add support for that as well.
        - When applicable, create a centralized website to list local servers.
- Meet accessibility standards.
- No nuisances which includes
    - Forced artificial intelligence.
    - Recommendation algorithms which need user data, history, third-party info.
        - Recommendations derived from a user’s follows and their extended network are permitted.
        - This has downside of confining people to a bubble. Add random recommendations to counter this.
    - Dark patterns.
    - Forced advertisements.
    - Changes to UI/UX should be opt-in, not forced.
        - Made new UI available through an opt-in toggle.
        - Provide documentation on how to move from old UI to new UI. Split the documentation as
            - New functionality.
            - Deprecated functionality. Provide reason.
            - Moved functionality.
- Optimize software, till limited by network, disk I/O.
    - Prefer hardware acceleration.
- Support greatest number of platforms.
    - Ability to use the entire app through API.
        - Allow users to create plugins.
    - Command line support.
    - Terminal user interface support. Use API to create simplified interface.
- Provide an iso file with operating system and ready to use program. This should not require any network access, except for downloading the iso.
    - Also, provide steps on creating the iso.
- Remain neutral. Avoid influence from politics, religion, geopolitics, or other external agendas.
- Respect right to repair. When making hardware do not employ dark patterns to make it harder for people to access, modify, and repair the machine as they wish to.
- An exception to the rules can be created for organizations that don't respect these rules.

    - [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://www.msci.com/indexes/index-resources/gics)

### Laboratory Inventory Management System (LIMS)

- Lims system using quickjs.
- Create an api for the entire project (this is not referring to the http api, but an api for getting info from the global config).
- Now for the UI of the LIMS system, you query the api and build the template. In this way, you can have multiple templates for the system. Every lab can easily build their own template.
    - Updating the software becomes easier as now you only have to update the api and if there are any breaking changes, you make the changes in the template.
    - As part of the default template, make the all the smaller components available for people to build their template on as well.
- Links
    - [link](https://www.labbit.com/) labbit
- On instrument page, drop file and choose any needed parameters, so that the loading of data is not dependent on filename. In case of incorrect format, show example of correct format.
- On sample submission page for client, ask for what tests they are requested in, and then ask for the relevant information for each test. Group the input fields or data they need to provide for sample into separate groups. One group would be the "minimum information required", and then admin can create more groups. Have each test associated with multiple groups if needed. Show the groups after user has done selecting all tests.
- On the permissions page to control access of employees to internal pages, use glob patterns to provide access to pages for employees. Document how to use glob pattern like file name, \*, \*\*. And any performance issues.
- On generated reports, show additional available insights or analysis. Like for feeds, the clients can run PMN calculator.
- For each sample, you will have to store the instrument minimum thresholds as well, since the thresholds can change over time. The data for previous samples should remain unaffected when changes are made to minimum thresholds.
    - Similarly, ranges for each element data. These can change over time, but the previous samples should not be affected.
    - In the JSON data for each sample, entries can be created for which instrument was used, instrument minimums, element ranges.
- Test all pages and reports using screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver). Include this in accessibility documentation section as well, and how to set them up (be careful with setting up though, since people who already use these would not change their settings for you).
- To add new items in the inventory management system add the following workflow
    - For each item, specify how to handle bringing the item in, how to handle it while moving internally, how to handle when removing.
    - For each action like bringing item in, the user can select from a dropdown or list of text that the admin has created for them.
    - Further split can be created in each category, like any special equipment requirement to handle like gloves, mask, moving with tray.
    - You can also specify, the room numbers where the item can possibly be.
    - This will primarily be text based, and the lab can create their own convention on how to specify the text.
- For employee page, give instructions on how they can line up all the employees and take picture with the best camera using square format head to above belly.
    - On the employee page, admin will select the employee and modify the picture.
- For reading data from instrument, first go to read data page, then choose instrument, then select one of the many tests that are conducted on the instrument, upload the file, choose the required variables (so that the filename does not matter).
- Choose between creating a read data page or incorporating read data on the instrument page. On the instrument page can can create subpages for each instrument like read data, view logs/summary of submitted data, documentation. Create section for installation for both software and hardware on the same page. For hardware this also includes where all the wires connect to the wall and the pc. Also include instrument maintenance and cleaning section.
- Create disaster recovery protocol and include it in the setup docs.
    - Have 2 pages.
    - First for promoting backup setver rack as primary. Focus on restoring database. The backup server is already running at the url like temp.lab.com and is only accessible internally. There is also a flag which prevents any database operation on this temp url, in case someone accidently accesses it. During disaster recovery, we first restore the database on the backup server, change the flag or redeploy with env variable to let all database operations, and now the lab can run as normal using the temp url. The lab can then focus on changing the url to the original.
    - For second backup page, we have to restore from offsite/offline backup. This is where the backip server is also not usable or there is ransomwhare on it. For offline it is not connected to the internet and cannot run any programs.
- Create a reference lims for aesl which is separate from the one they are using. This reference will act as a guide for when labs are building their own. In the documentation the reference lims system will be referenced.
- Have a single left sidebar, which lists all the applications. For something like i struments, it will list all the pages underneath. Do not create two sidebars.
- For each page of the application have an exit function which will run, when the user tries to navigate away from the page. You can use this to check for any unsaved data.
- Look into splitting the database for each year and tracking where the database for that year is stored. For older fiscal years we can move the database to slower archival storage and the programs will still work.
- Add ability to video call, audio call employees. This can get rid of internal phones, and other subscriptions to do zoom and phone calls. Similar to leave page, add a page for meetings, and making it easier to add and view meetings.
    - Add page to do employee polls. And client polls/surveys.
    - Issue tracker, tracker for legal issues.
    - For a lot of these pages, things can be kept simple by letting people enter Rich Text, and the first page being a template page, which users can copy or it gets pasted by default.
    - Page for chatting. Just have simple chat of people sending messages. Show a red dot in the notication bar of the receiptient. At the end of the day send, a summary email to all employees, with all the messages that they received. Instead of defining a single time like 5pm, have an array, and use the messages within two consecutive times to send the summary. Users can create group chats.
- When creating the LIMS system, be mindful of the same lab being spread in multiple places, and each place doing the same tests. Maybe for every test, we need to define an arry of labs that it can belong to.
- Rather than creating user permissions for special things like creating poll, legal stuff. Create a subpage called "Create" which can also be used to make templates. And then the user who has access to the page will be the only one able to create.
- In responsibilities page, add list of responsibilities generated by the lims system. Like all the admin related stuff. Look at each page of the system and figure out what responsibilities you can come up with.
- For login in addition to email/password support email only with 2fa, passkey only (the admin will have to log into the database manually to reset their)
- Documentation will be in English. But the UI will be internatiolized. Make the internaolization build only, so you are generating ui for all the languages in different folders like en, fr.
- When logging in the sample, create a specimen number (similar to sample ID). This can inculde the date and a daily counter,a nd some other information. Look up things like "Importance of sample identification" like 2026-0004521-A.
- AESL workflow is more of analytical workflow, where you run sample in instrument and read the data. Biotech labs are trying to merge different aspects into one big system
- Help labs create workflow modeling, essentially how a sample moves within a lab.
- In instrument page, have global section for when you multiple of the same instrument. You will still have site specific instrument setup instructions.
- Sample tracking page. The page will show all the samples at the lab that still have to be run. A technician will check the page, select the samples that they will be running.
- Data analysis. Create a new page, where technicans can upload Excel file, or run a sql query to get the data. And then do all the data analysis related stuff. Essentially everything that they can do in Excel, libraries like pandas, matplotlib. So filter data, clean data, create graphs, get metrics.
- Create helper for writing SQL. It will show the tables, columns and the user can click them to paste in the editor and with the appropriate data types. Further show all the functions you can write in the where clause. Group them for easier use, and clicking a function would paste it in the editor. Also, create an autocomplete dropdown as the user is typing to fill in the columns, functions.
- For every data table, have option to export to various formats like Excel, txt, csv, json. Have option to open the table in Data analysis page. This data table is not the same as the database table, and instead what is being shown in the UI.
- From the sample submission page, create html editable forms for each test or subset of tests as well. Clients can print the written form, or print and then handwrite the form.
- Create a page to transform Json structure of sample or other cokumn. This will apply the transformation to all the previous samples. There will be some downtime, but that is a tradeoff to make the process simple. There might be times when the lab was storing info from instrument, but now that data needs to be split into 2 columns.
- Create section to for all the word files, excel files, powerpoint files in LIMS. Use HTML to create these instead. The files will be organized by templates (with subfolders) as needed. For every HTML page, there will be an option to load previous entered data or enter new data or modify one of the old data. Save the changes with date and a comment. People can print these pages and share with people. Make these accessible as well.

#### SQL page

![](../assets/projects/lims-sql-page.png)

- Two rows
- The layout fits on the screen and users will have to scroll for the overflow.
- I am essentially helping people build the filters/transformations that data tables generally have he controls for in the table itself. But instead of building those controls int he data table itself, I have the users open this page.
- Bottom row
    - Show a dummy table with multiple columns and 3 rows.
    - Add a message at top. Showing 3 rows for performance.
- Top row
    - Tow column with sidebar on left to select the controls.
        - In sidebar have a group for columns, which will list all the columns of the table. Have + , - sign next to it, to add the column in the right column.
        - Have a metrics group, which will show things like mean, max, .... These metrics can be added for before filtering the data and/or after filtering the data.
        - Have charts group, where users can add various charts for the columns.
        - Have filtering group for things like, startswith, endswith, includes
        - Have transformation group for things like toupeprcase, data type conversion, ...
    - In the right column, for every column added add this ui.
        - Show the column header
        - Show an input box, where they will essentially enter the filtering or transformation.
        - To the righ side have an "or" and another input box. If they type into this, another "or" input would be created.
        - To the bottom have an "and" and another input box. If they type into this, another "and" input would be created.
        - Have different sections for filtering, transformation, metrics within each column, so that users know here to input each thing and they do not get confused.
    - The user can click on the things in the sidebar and it will add them to the active input box.

### Agriculture SAAS

- What are the different types of things where agriculture related stuff is relevant (like water, soil, ...).
- Now dig deeper into each type.
- For water, where are all the places it is used (tap water, water filtration system, desalination systems, agriculture, acquarium, ships, ...).
- For each use case, build a simpler 3d printed model, to understand how these systems are constructed. Like how a tap water is built from the tap, to the pipes that carry the water. These will help identify issues that are impossible to think about just mentally.
- For each use case, identify the analysis or test that is relevant.
- In addition to the 3d model, make an animation that can be used to teach people how the system they are using is constructed.
- Consolidate all agriculture related software companies, precision agriculture, research papers.
- Show how much people are saving by using this project. For every usecase, anlysis show the price from commercial companies.

### Accessibility

- Works on all operating systems. Handles all file formats like Web, PDF.

## VPN Performance Check

- Use vpn to check your site performance across counties.
- Can use aws vps as well.

## Better Tech Name

- Use domain `bettertechname.com`.
- Come up with alternative names for GPUs/CPUs/RAM/Monitors (desktop, enterprise, mobile).
- General strategy: bigger the number better the product.
    - Consult research papers to understand the architecture of each product.
    - Each product begins with the year the architecture was released not the product was released.
- Have a (autogenerated) section for each product to explain the rationale behind the name.
- For USB distill it down to Data and Power (D= and P=).
- Also create SVG logos in different sizes for the new names. Smaller logos will have less/compressed info.

## Programming Langauge

- Create transpiler for programming languages to Rust. For each language look at the top libraries and transpile them as a proof of concept. Also, check performance of the transpiled to the original.
    - If a language has a specific tooling built around it, build that for the Rust version as well.
- Create an intermediate language and transpile from that to target language.

### File Formats

- Create a performance optimized parser (using SIMD assembly) for XML, HTML, CSS, TOML, ...

### Fortran

- Start from 66 standard and work your way up (look into various compiler options also)
- [fortran-lang.org](https://fortran-lang.org/)
- [fortranwiki.org](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/HomePage)
- Wiki has list of libraries using Fortran. Transpile them to C++, make test cases pass, test for performance to act as a proof of concept.
- Use the official compilers for this task.

## Database

- Go through postgres documentation and create an admin panel to configure all the settings, this includes options for compiling postgres from source.
    - For options which can take multiple values like page size, offer a testing utility which users can use to get the best value.
    - Provide guide on meaning of all values and how to choose the appropriate one.
    - [link](https://postgresqlco.nf/) Page listing configuration options and tuning guide.
- Go through all the Postgre Weekly newsletters and add stuff from there.
- Look at databases built on top of Postgres and merge their features.
- Look at databases outside of Postgres and merge their features.
- CLI to create josn schema of all tables, typescript format, format for other languages.
- Some queries integrate data from previous years, and the output rarely changes. The output from previous years can be cached. Create interface where you keep track of such queries and update the cache. If intergation can be made on when was the table last modified, the update of query output can be automated.
- Development database setup and easier way to run queries in dev mode before pushing to production. In dev mode, add methods to easily add worst case inputs for the queries. And also test for performance.
- For migrations provide two functions for each function. How to upgrade and how to downgrade. And then it is to the user to handle the logic. The software handles the execution of these functions and can be used to roll back 100 migrations if the logic allows it.
    - During migration we might have to look into load balancing and how to migrate when the database is really huge.
- High availability
    - patroni
- Add backup testing, backup restore. Disaster recovery.
- Have a test section to test queries like update, delete, create. The section automatically wraps the query in transaction and after you are confident you can commit the transaction.

### Access

- Create transpiler and tooling to migrate from Access database system.

## Coding Live Documentation Viewer

- When writing say Rust, depending on where cursor is, show the official documentation for that thing in a browser window. As you type, the page keeps getting updated.
- For this to work, offline documentation would work best. And for navigation using URL (file path) would be best.
- In addition show custom user documentation, which can include like performance characteristics of each thing, accessibility, security, usage examples, best practices.
- Another pane can show the piece of code at different compiler stages.
- Show the dependency graph of the assmebly for the current function or lines of code. Refer to Casey Computer Enhance course (Linking Directly to ASM for experimentation).
    - Add the ability to modify the assembly manually (temporarily) and see how the dependency graph changes.

## SEO

- Combine all SEO products from [link](https://github.com/serpapi/awesome-seo-tools) into a single app.
    - Add these as well [link](https://kushaj.com/product-design/seo).
    - Wordpress aioseo.
- Reference SEO notes for more ideas.

### PWA

- Checker which shows the rendering of all the options.

### HTML Head Generator

- To generate a template for all the tags that you can possibly enter in HTML head.
- This can be `<meta>` tags or HTTP relevant or a function that returns the HTML.
- Refer capo.js on how to order head elements for performance.

## HTML checker

- For every HTML tag check if the children tag valid. It will be a hashmap, with a key for each html tag and the value will be a set of all valid tags.
- Show the DOM tree of the code you are working on in the documentation viewer or in a new tab.
- Check if html tags have valid attributes.

## Diagram

- Reference [UI LIbrary-2D visualization](#2d-visualizations) before working on this.
- Reference all the diagramming tools out there and create a single tool with all the features.
- Include collaborative features as well using local server.
- Make it work online completely client side, with option to sync to storage like google drive. Add option to share with people.
- Create a programming language interface to draw the diagram through code.

## Qwik Lite

- Use vite+ for qwik.
- Add schema.org
- Sort the tags in head.
- Helper to view component in different sizes, zooms, and other stuff.
- Remove all the unncessary stuff from qwik like api functions. It should just be a UI layout framework.
- Remove npm dependency. Have all the dependencies already in node_modules folder without a need to install.
- Integrate OpenDesignSystem and other stuff/tools you use.

## UI Library

- Create a UI library for Qwik js (or framework agnostic) with inspiration from shadcn.
- Add design design from UI collective. Split it into files, with the base where you define the colors, and other values being in a separate file, that can be exported and imported easily.
- Look up all the UI libraries out there and add their components.
- For each component, have a separate file/layer for print, accessibilty options, keyboard shortcuts, event listeners.
- Add option to add changes to inputs, text fields, dropdowns to the URL. This is relevant to use URL as state management. Check [/product-design/seo/url.html#url-as-state-management](/product-design/seo/url.html#url-as-state-management).
- Add performance optimization for things like toggle. Even though toggle is a boolean, it takes 1 byte in memory. Multiple toggles can be packed together using bitwise operators. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7wVUfnm7M0).
- Keyboard shortcuts should be opt-in, and give user the option to change them.
- Components
    - Header - Similar to amazon mobile app, the header background fades if you have not scrolled for some time, and then the text fades as well.
    - [link](https://rednegra.net/blog/20260212-virtual-scroll/?ck_subscriber_id=2308324911) Virtual Scrolling for Billions of Rows
- Look at ui/ux related to architecture like nuclear plants and architecture where they have control panels.

### OpenDesignSystem

- This will be the main project for the components.
- First build the design system using raw css and js. Use modern css to split everything into files. For js use modules.
- Write extensive documentation on why the code is structured in the given way to meet semantic guidelines, user experience.
- First folder will contain all the variable like colors and spaces.
- Second folder will be the reset/html tags. Create styles for each html tag individually.
- Component folder. This folder will contain the components.
- After writing js with jsdoc, create a separate version for Qwik.
- Create a component for all the accessibility needs.

### Markdown Editor

- Markdown -> HTML -> PDF
- Show live preview of PDF export.

### CSS Style Sorter

- Sort CSS style properties similar to how Tailwind sort's the class names.
- Add sorting logic for both inline, and stylesheet.

### Media Optimizer

- Image/audio/video/svg best practices in HTML.
- For images, generate responsive img and picture tags.
- Look at sharp, Nextjs img, cloudfare cloudinary.

### Code Snippet

- Create a code snippet module. Check all the documentation generators and copy their features.
- Add compiler outputs, print output, advanced stuff like assembly output, or whatever is relevant to that language.
- See typescript, swift docs for inspiration.
- Add optional feature for formatting the code using offical formatters of each language.
- Comments/Code can be highlighted for warming, danger, info, ...
- All the code in the codeblock should be generated at build time, including line numbers.

### Code Transition

- Code transition animation as seen in youtube videos.
- Component to show code and syntax highlighting like Shiki. Look at astro for all the things it can do.

### Storybook

- Render the component at different resolutions, different browsers.
- It integrates with the design system, and provides a page to adjust the design system and see the new rendering of the components. From the page, the design system can be exported to be used in your library (or just saved directly to the file).
- Integrate testing to show the components for all test cases.
- Add documentation on how to use the component.
- Take screenshots of the components from all browsers. Look into using OBS (or native Linux APIs to capture screenshot).
- Add view of the component with the popular chrome extensions installed

### Accessibility

- In the storybook app, add diffeerent accessibility renderings as well.
- Integrate everything related to accessibility in the app. Things like stark app.

### 2D-Visualization

- Charts.
    - When creating charts, look into how people of different calibre would use and understand the info.

## Code To UML Generator

- Create program that reads file and removes all code between start and end comment block.
- Use the code in between to generate UML diagram, and generate image from that.
- This can be used to visualize if/else other loop logic regardless of programming langauge, as we are still relying on the user to define the diagram and doing any programming language code parsing.
- The user will have to define an identifier which links the current code to some global object (identifying the function for which we are creating the diagram) and then define the logic for if/else and other things.
- Also, try generating an automatic diagram for the entire code. Start with main function and then all the functions that it calls. Show sequential and parallel function calls.

### Parallel Code Finder

- Find parts of functions that can be parallelized or made async. Do it automatically and compare the performance differences.
- Create a simple UI to show what changes were made.
- Combine this with a profiler where you get time taken by each line, or function. Then you can say the profiler has these lines with the worst performance, reference it with parallel and only optimize these.

## Wayland/X11

- Create a Wayland/X11 alternative.
- Some ultrawide monitors splitting single monitor into 2. Can this be implemented at software level, and let users define custom regions on their monitors, to act as sub monitors similar to ultrawide.
- Dell monitors have Dell Display Manager, which uses DDC/CI protocol to change monitor settings. When creating the alternative, also create a GUI thing, and in the GUI add features from the Dell Display Manager as well (change brightness, color mode, ...).
- Global shortcut for window movement to left, right, top, bottom. Use Win + UpArrow to move window up. Press up arrow twice to expand the window to entire top 50% width. Then downArrow would move it to smaller top region. For multi monitors, do Win + 2 + UpArrow, where 2 is for the second monitor. This will move the window to the number 2 monitor. Also, provide option to define these regions like top-left, top-right, .... And then use Win + arrow keys to move around.
- Use CSS names for all the things. Like for borders, provide option to control border for each window separately. On the programming side, this can be achieved by using a unique dictionary key corresponding to the window and then defining the boder options, including the monitor to show on and the placement within the monitor as well.
    - Include all the unique features from tiling window managers as well.
- Programming interface allows any application to open a new window, with all the config options. As long as the dictionary key name is unique, applications can control exactly how to display their window (this does include things like excluding the top bar with minimize, close buttons, and changing position to top-bar, buttons).
- Explore the idea of unfragmenting Linux, like having universal settings menu.
- Check [river](https://codeberg.org/river/river).
- In display protocol project, include standard linux things that distros dont need to support, and call it unification of distro and helping hardware manufactures support linux, things like power management, wifi, bluetooth, rgb lighting, and more hardware that uses open standards like keyboards. For rgb expand it to include all metrics, like gpu temps, psu, motherboard and others which users can query against to create anything.
- Look at all the popular linux distros and the programs they have like [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/).

## Basketball Stats

- For every stat in basketball, find its meaning and how to actually use it (without stat padding).
    - For example, number of rebounds is a false metric. Because a reboud can be contested and uncontested, your teammate might box out making it easier for you to rebound. A better look at this metric is what is the rebound number of the team with/without you.
    - For example, number of blocks is a false metric. A better metric is opponent at-rim field goal percentage (on-off). The reason being having blocks does not give complete picture of defense. You may still be weak and get pushed around and in general cannot keep up with defensive assignment. Also, use opponent at-rim shot frequency (on-off).
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhLIh4XQQjo) for reference.
- Do the above for every stat.
- Make it easy to make charts from these, like you see on youtube videos. Let people choose a player and time period and add it to the graph.
- Look at popular youtube basketball videos and add the graphs they use in the program as well.

## Rust Dynamic Library

- When installing library through Cargo, all the dependencies have to recompiled. Since rust has no stable ABI, there are differences in the compiled binary across different compiler versions.
- Create a wrapper around cargo installer, which will install/get libraries from a shared folder.
- When the compiler is updated, recompile all the libraries as well.
- Features from security area can be added, like creating dependency graph, checking for outdated dependencies.

## Exercise Research

- Write a paper on how doing multiple sports can prevent injuries.
- Goal: If you are a kid use this protocol, and this might help you with reaching professional league, but this will defintiely help you stay healthier and injury free in your 60s.
- Look at different sports, and parts they normally use, and make a series of sports that cover all parts of the body, without overusing the same part over and over again.
- Look at mentality, physicality aspect of the sports as well.
- Give suggestions like playing with old people, young people, left/right hand, playing with woman if you are a man. This covers playing the same sport slowly (against old people), and faster (against younger people).

## Bike Car Cover

- Look at [optimesit](https://optimeist.com/).

## Project Dependency Tracker

- For all your personal projects (external projects as well), create a UI that shows all the dependency versions being used.
- Show how the current version compares to the latest.
- Show link to the release notes, and a script that can automatically submit pull request for updating the dependency.

### Personal Info

- In addition to tracking project version, track smaller bits of info that can change over time like name, address.
    - Some text that you put in the README.
    - Some link that you shared. Places where you shared the link.
- Include locations of all your social media, or places where you have created an account, provided payment info, provided address info. And a link to modify/delete the relevant info.

## Configurable Formatter

- Unopinionated prettier alternative. In Markdown, prettier would currently format codeblocks and that would mess up JS code. And the way to avoid this is by adding prettier ignore comments, which is annoying.
- Split the project into core module and language specific modules.
- Clear all [prettier tests](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/tests/format) to ensure success.
- All the 3rd party plugins/integrations should work automatically. For this you might have to force people to rename your package to "prettier" manually (or through a script, soft alias).
- Make every formatting option of prettier available as a config option.
- Additionally, code inside codeblocks should be formatted as per the provided language.
- Provide a config file, which includes all the config options, that people can read top-to-bottom. This is one thing that I found annoying with current tools, as you have to check the docs for all possible options and sometimes they are not even documented properly.
- Look at prettier alternatives like [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) written in Rust and do speed comparisons and OxcFormat.
- For every possible formatting done by Prettier, expose a function letting people build their own logic on how to format that option. For example, if you have code that handle formatting ternaries, then expose a function that can override that behavior.
- Look into all the programming languages out there and integrate their AST into the project, and then provide an option to format each node. This would make the project a universal formatter.

## HTML DOM Analyzer

- There are chrome extensions that deal with analyzing DOM like number of nodes. Consolidate all the extensions into one script/extension.
- Chrome console shows DOM after JS render. Ctrl-U shows HTML returned by the server. In the chrome DOM, spaces and newline nodes are not shows. In your project show these as well.
- Add a graph showing the dom depth.
- Given the html, show step by step the graph being built.
- For browsers, show how this is translated to graphics layers and all the intermediary.

### Parser library

- Create a utility library that exposes the HTML parser, and can work on both full-HTML string and streaming HTML.
- For the streaming HTMl, build a visualization tool to show how the DOM looks over time.
- Show where the parser got halted. Like script, link, style tags halt the HTML parser. How can this information be made available to the users.

## UI Helper

- Take all the advise from UI courses and books and convert it into automatic checker.
- The checker can maybe take the screenshot of the component as input and then run all the checks. Or it can take the source code and work from there.

## HTML Linter

- In the spec, there are ton of recommendations, plus errors which browsers respect. And all this information can be converted to linting rules.
- For each tag look into
    - how many times they can appear in the DOM. Like `<title>` can only appear once and in the `<head>`.
    - the possible attribute values, and no duplication of attributes.
- Security best practices, should also be integrated. This includes how to get rid of all security attacks like cross-site, and more (as mentioned in the spec).
- For SSR framework, get all the routes and then run the linter on the generated HTML. Since in SSR, all HTML is hidden in JS and linter would not be of much use.
- `<p><p>Text</p></p>` - Linter can look into unnecessary tags as well. What is nested div's are used, but the code be replaced with just one div.
- h1 tags should be in order, and there should be no skipping.
- After reading best UI practices, see if these guidelines can be translated to a linter.
- Ensure all the tags are closed. Every tag (should probably) have a certain number of valid tags that can be nested inside of it. This information might be helpful for guessing if the tag was closed or not. When using the HTML parser, you have to look into if the AST returned includes auto-closing nodes added by the parser, which is what we don't want. The reason why we don't want auto-closing tags, is it sometimes results in weird behavior.
    - This website lists [most common errors](https://htmlparser.info/conformance-checkers/).

## Spellcheck Program

- Create spell check program.
- Look at VSCode [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension.
- For example, in case of HTML, the HTML spec contains all the valid words. So just add every word of HTML spec into the spell check dictionary, and this should include HTML specific words. You can look into creating separate dictionaries for each language.
- An alternative, is to look into the grammar of each language and add all the keywords and stuff like that. Also, for each language there are rules like, the function name can be anything, so spell checker should not be enforced there.

- Every axiomatic system had a history. Had a motivation. Worked through loads of examples and counterexamples to motivate and finally settle on a specific definition that's both general enough to capture a sufficiently wide variety of interesting problems, but also specific enough so that we can actually prove interesting results about them.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0ZVe9AtgUg Create your own math book for subfields of math, and do motivation, history, examples, use cases, arguments against and then do the usual stuff that current books do.

- Create a transpiler from maybe Flutter or Rust.
- Create tool similar to Android Studio or Figma or Blocks or the arrow thing in video editors but for the entire SDK, making all of the SDK being programmed just using Figma like UI.
    - Show the rendering on all the watch faces, and provide option to customize the selected watches manually.
    - Tool to check all the functions, arguments of SDK on physical hardware. This is necessary since the documentation is lacking, and this can act as a source of truth.
- Create custom metrics
    - Heart rate value, bar underneath to see where in the zone you are.
    - Cycle gear front or back (maybe both). Combine it with heart rate to see both at same time.
    - Avg power, and show +/- value (+10 means right left is generating more power) in brackets.
    - Elevation gain and distance. From current point, find max local peak and how far it is and show those two values. Do the same for elevation loss. Maybe both can be combined in one field or outputted side by side.
    - Combine speed fields into one as well (with +/-) to compress. Like show speed and show +2 to mean the avg is +2 of current.
    - Combine distance fields. Current distance, distance to next stop (show it as +value), and same for total distance remaining (as +value).

    - Add optional video in case the context is complex.
    - Add constraint text as well.
- This UI not gets shipped to the third-party that will handle the translation. After doing the translation for an element, they press done to confirm.
    - Maybe it shows them the rendered component as well in different languages.
- On the developer side, they choose a base language. When they update an element in this language, only then the other languages will get missing translation flag.
    - In the UI component visualization project add support to render component in multiple translations.

## Handwritten Assembly

- Make a framework to make it easier to write assembly, with memory checks similar to rust.
- Add security checks for handwritten assembly similar to rust borrow checker.
