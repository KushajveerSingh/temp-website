## Traditional SEO

-   Focus on _content quality_ and _crawler hints_.
-   Frequent updates, link building.
-   Keyword stuffing and using long tail keywords (multi-word phrases) to find very specific information, as site visitors are likely to use these keywords when they are closer to a point-of-purchase.
-   PageRank algorithm assumed "quality" of a site is proportional to the number of links to it. And the value of a link on a "quality site" is worth more.

### Example

-   Create a complete [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com/us/business-profile/).
-   Ask for reviews for your business, and display on your website.
-   Submit your business to local directories.
-   Correct errors/outdated information in local citations.
-   Acquire local backlinks - vendors, partners, local NGOs.
-   In Google Search Console, specify your site is only for a specific region.

### Optimize PageRank

-   Create _key pages_ for popular product and services on your website.
-   Focus inbound links to key pages to build higher ranking pages.
-   Guest post on trustworthy industry/authroity sites.
-   Analyze competitors link profile and identify link opportunities.
-   Eliminate bad links
    -   Use Google Search Console to review search traffic and links.
    -   Remove link reference from spammy websites.
    -   Eliminate mutual _link exchange_ with other sites using `<rel="nofollow">`.
    -   Remove dead links from your website.
-   Do Google Ad Campaign.

## Structured data

-   Provide consistent structure, across websites.
-   Use JSON-LD syntax over HTML. Get the syntax from schema.org.
-   Adding this information helps us control the way search results look.

## Mobile optimization

-   Google uses a different index for mobile and desktop.
-   Provide information in manifest.json.

## Technical SEO

-   Create `sitemap.xml`.
-   Crawl depth of any page should be lower than 4 (i.e. any given page should be reached with no more than 3 clicks from the homepage).
-   Remove duplicate content. For duplicate pages, use redirect 301.
-   Update `robots.txt` to hide pages that you don't want Google to index. For example, non-public, unimportant pages. For a SAAS this would be most of the in-app pages.
